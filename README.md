# Apathy Popcorn Client

heya guys

## Usage

1. Order a popcorn ticket using Apathy's Discord bot.
2. If you haven't already, open the popcorn client. This will allow you to use the ticket.
3. Visit the URL provided in the ticket. If it is valid, the local server will automatically launch
a roblox instance.
4. When you are finished, you may close the popcorn client. This will also disable Multiple Roblox,
closing all but one open roblox instance.

## FAQs

1. **What even is this?**
If you haven't heard of or aren't affiliated with Apathy's popcorn system, don't worry about it :)
2. **Why did you switch to a new client?**
Because my code is better.
3. **Why can't we order popcorn from this client?**
It's mostly a security measure. We can more easily monitor who uses which popcorn when you request
popcorn through the bot. Additionally, we won't have to use your IP or HWID since the Discord bot
provides us with your Discord ID.
4. **Then what does this client even do?**
It creates a local server on your computer that serves as a bridge between Apathy's discord bot and
your Roblox client. In short, the bot gives you a popcorn ticket which the client uses to launch a
Roblox instance. The client also enables you to launch multiple Roblox instances.
5. **Can I trust this client?**
The source code been made fully available (see License). You also have access to the client's
virustotal in the Apathy discord. If you are still unsure, I will be releasing documentation for
all of this repository's code in the near future. As per the license, you may also ~~skid~~ utilize
the code available here to build your own client that interfaces with Apathy's popcorn system.
